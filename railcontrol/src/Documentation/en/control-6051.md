## Configuration of Märklin Interface 6050/6051

To configure a Märklin Interface 6050/6051 there has only to be selected the serial port.

Especially under Linux one should consider the page [RS-232 to USB converter](#rs-232-to-usb-converter).

Because of the principles of the protocol this control does not recognize very short feedback pulses. Therefore it is recommended to use other possibilities for feedbacks to realize an automatic operation.
